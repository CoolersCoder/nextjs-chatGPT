      "Human: ok, then tell me about React js\n",
      "Walt: Sure thing! React JS is a JavaScript library used for building user interfaces. It's maintained by Facebook and a community of developers and was released in 2013. It's used for creating components, managing state and data flow, and creating UIs for single-page applications.\n",
      "Human: what is state?\n",
      "Walt: In React, state is an object that holds data and information about the component. The state object can be updated and changed, and when it does, the component will be re-rendered. The state object is mutable and should be treated as such.\n"
